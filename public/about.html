<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name's Ricardo. I enjoy movies and birthday parties. Also snacks and long walks with great company.</p>

<p>The first coding language I tried to learn was Python. What a language to start with. After that i learned Html and Css. 
  Compared to Python, Html and Css were too easy.
